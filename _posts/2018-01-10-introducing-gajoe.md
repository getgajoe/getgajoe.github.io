# Why G.A. Joe?

### No Switching Tabs or Windows
These metrics can also be brought together in a GA custom dashboard. But, you need to make these dashboards for each of your accounts. If you have more than 1 site, you may find trouble switching multiple tabs or windows just to get a quick overview.

### Set Targets and Track
G.A. Joe allows you to set monthly targets against your most important KPIs. It provides you with a context on how the business is performing without spending a lot of time.

### Share your data
Sharing GA with your clients, affiliates, vendors is easier with G.A. Joe. Simply select a board and limit the data to the source that you want others to see.

### Alerts (coming soon)
G.A. Joe goes beyond simple daily alerts. Now you can be alerted if you have no or low traffic as early as it happens. Get to know when there is an upward or downward trend in any of your KPI. This allows you to react quickly and make the most of it.
