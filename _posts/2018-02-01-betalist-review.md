Like any new startup, I am exploring multiple channels to promote [G.A. Joe](https://gajoe.co?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=betalist) as much as I can. I used Betalist for promotion and to reach out to the early beta adopters. I have used Betalist in past with satisfactory to good results. With this blog post, I want to provide a quick summary of the campaign's performance and hopefully this will help other founders make informed decision.

### What is Betalist?
For those who are not aware of Betalist, you can visit [their site](https://betalist.com) to know more. 

This is their pitch (taken from their site)

>BetaList is a community of makers and early adopters showcasing their startups and exchanging feedback.

Betalist always figures as one of the top places to promote startups in almost all such lists that can be found on internet.

### Performance results

I submitted G.A. Joe on Betalist on 16th of January. I opted to pay US$ 129 to expedite the review process. They are very responsive and it took them around 24 hours to get in touch and to make sure everything is ready to be [featured](https://betalist.com/startups/g-a-joe). There is also a FREE option in case one can wait, though, it could be a long wait.

### Final comments

+ If you look at their twitter feed, almost all posts have similar number of retweets and likes. 
	- On reaching out to them and reading their FAQs, it seems this is due to bots doing auto-retweets as part of their older system. 
	- This could be misleading and one need to be careful on their exact engagement numbers.
+ Avg CPC is very close to what other channels might perform.
+ I am withholding the exact signup numbers as they do not reflect directly on Betalist performance.
+ These results can vary from one startup to another.

While, I have your attention, please check out [G.A. Joe](https://gajoe.co?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=betalist). We are still very early and looking for BETA users to provide valuable feedback.
